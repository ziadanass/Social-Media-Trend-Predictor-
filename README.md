# Social-Media-Trend-Predictor
# 📈 Social Media Trend Predictor

This project uses Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithms to optimize posting times on social media, helping content creators and marketers identify the *best day and hour* to post for maximum engagement.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

In a world filled with digital noise, *when* you post on social media can be just as important as *what* you post.  
This system analyzes past performance data and uses ML + GA to:

- Predict expected engagement (likes, comments, shares)
- Optimize the best *day + time* to post

---
## 🧠 Technologies Used

- *Python*
- *Pandas, NumPy* – Data handling
- *Scikit-learn* – Machine Learning models
- *Matplotlib / Seaborn* – Visualization
- *Genetic Algorithm* – Custom implementation for scheduling optimization
- *Jupyter Notebook* – Development & analysis

---

## 🗃 Dataset

The dataset includes:

- Day of the week
- Hour of posting
- Post type (image/video/text)
- Actual performance (likes, comments, shares)
- Other metadata if available

📁 Example file: social_media_posts (1).csv

---
## ⚙ How It Works

1. *Data Preprocessing*
   - Clean missing or irrelevant data
   - Feature engineering (encode days/hours/post type)

2. *ML Model*
   - Trained to predict engagement score
   - Model used: e.g., RandomForestRegressor or any suitable regression model

3. *Genetic Algorithm*
   - Population: Candidate posting schedules
   - Fitness: Predicted engagement score
   - Crossover & Mutation to evolve best posting time

4. *Result*
   - Recommended top posting times
